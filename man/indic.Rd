indic(evi, cut, cases)
}
\arguments{
\item{evi}{numeric vector - object (obtained from the evi function and stored as ev) that corresponds to the relative change in the standard deviation.}

\item{cut}{threshold value (0 <= c <= 0.5) for issuing an early warning. If evi >= c an early warning is issued and otherwise is not.}

\item{cases}{numeric vector with the number of new cases per unit of time (i.e., daily).}
}
\description{
Index = 1 when an early warning is issued and Index=0 when an early warning is not issued
}
\examples{
data("Italy")
cases = mova(cases=Italy$Cases, r_a=7)
roll = rollsd(cases=cases, lag_t=7)
ev = evi(rollsd=roll)
ind=indic(evi=ev, cut=0.01, cases=cases)
